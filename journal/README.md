# Innovation/Ideation Journal
- This directory will be eventually migrated to its own branch off of master, to free up clone size.
- Drawing/Whiteboard files are directly exported from iOS Bamboo and committed here with a comment regarding its contents
- We avoid timelines here
- Not all initial investigations into requirements in these documents are required for the v1.0.0 release
- When appropriate, "Pie in the Sky" dreams are labeled and captured until later scoping to avoid creep
