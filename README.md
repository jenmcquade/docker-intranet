## Project TLDR;
* The objective of this environment is to enable small business owners to manage a hybrid cloud, with zero to little overhead.
* This project is broken out into functional use cases. The /ops and /dns directories contain most of the services that support each of the frontend entrypoints, like Plex Media Server and SuiteCRM.
* This project will eventually be migrated to https://github.com/indiewebconsulting and supported there.
* The timeline for v1.0.0 release is mid-August 2019, with hardware integration in September, and customer beta testing in October.
* ARM64/aarch64 hardware is developed and integrated first, followed by x64/amd64 support.
* To cultivate a stable environment, forks of existing projects will only be updated through pulls/patches.
* Where we can, we store the original forked GitHub project for each integration in project.url of the directory of the service.
* v1 exists because of the support of Indie Web Consulting, Tacoma, WA and its patrons.
